# ArkID Integration Using Keycloak

**Version:** 1.1.0  
**Last Updated:** April 25, 2025 
**Status:** Draft

## **Introduction**

ArkID aims to be a unique identifier system for the ResearchArk platform, capable of generating standardized ISO-27729 identifiers for the complete research innovation chainâ€”ideas, researchers, projects, organizations, and products. Unlike existing systems like ORCID, ArkID solves the specific problem of managing complex relationships between different research entities across the entire innovation lifecycle, ensuring traceability and unified identification for all stakeholders in the research ecosystem. 

ArkID provides identifiers not only for individual researchers but also for ideas, projects, organizations, and research outputs. This enhances traceability across different research entities and ensures a holistic integration of all key players in the research ecosystem. ArkID will be a secure, memorable identifier that provides easy identification and authentication across the entire ResearchArk ecosystem. It will also allow all entity types to be identified uniquely, accessible via a user-friendly URL format, such as `https://arkid.researchark.eu/{arkid}`.

Keycloak will be used as the Identity Provider (IdP) to manage authentication and assign ArkIDs to users. Keycloak was chosen over other identity management systems because of its robust support for modern authentication protocols (such as OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0), ease of integration, scalability, and extensive customization options, which make it well-suited to meet the complex needs of the ResearchArk platform. However, additional functionalities, such as assigning ArkIDs to ideas, projects, organizations, and products, will require custom workflows to fully integrate the broader ResearchArk ecosystem.

ArkID is designed to simplify how different actors within the ResearchArk community interact by providing a centralized authentication and identification solution. Whether the entity is an idea, user, project, organization, or product, ArkID enables streamlined identification and enhances the efficiency of managing research-related credentials. The use of Keycloak as a foundation for ArkID means we can leverage industry-standard identity and access management protocols, ensuring reliability and scalability for future expansion.

### **ArkID Requirements**

1. **Unique, Human-Readable ArkIDs:** IDs need to be unique, memorable, and easy to comply with ISO standards. UUIDs are not preferred due to their length and complexity, which may hinder ease of use and communication.
2. **Entity Support:** ArkID must be capable of supporting identifiers for:
   - Ideas (initial research concepts)
   - Users/Researchers (login/auth)
   - Projects (funded research initiatives)
   - Organizations (research institutions and partners)
   - Products/Outputs (research results, prototypes, publications)
3. **User Ownership & Permissions:** Users with an ArkID should be able to create ArkIDs for ideas, projects, organizations, or products if they can verify their authorization. This ownership capability ensures that only verified individuals are able to create and manage the ArkIDs.
4. **URL Resolution:** The ArkID must be publicly resolvable, e.g., `https://arkid.researchark.eu/{arkid}`, which will link to either a profile or metadata page.
5. **Data Privacy and Security:** Users should be able to control what information is publicly accessible, ensuring their privacy preferences are respected across all entities in the ResearchArk ecosystem.
6. **Verifiable Credentials:** The system must support W3C verifiable credentials standards to ensure tamper-evident provenance chains.
7. **Temporal Relationship Tracking:** ArkID must track relationships between entities over time, including start and end dates of associations.
8. **Digital Sovereignty:** The infrastructure must be EU-hosted and governed to ensure data sovereignty.

## **ArkID Schema Design**

### **1. ArkID Format**

To ensure ArkIDs are compliant with the **ISO 27729 (ISNI)** standard, each ArkID contains a **16-digit numerical value** that remains unique for each entity type, along with an **alphanumeric prefix** to identify the type of entity. The combination of a prefix and a numeric value enhances usability by making it easier to identify the type of entity at a glance, which improves readability and reduces the likelihood of confusion compared to using only a numerical value.

Format examples:
- **Idea ArkID:** `https://arkid.researchark.eu/ARKI-0000000112233445`
- **User ArkID:** `https://arkid.researchark.eu/ARKU-0000000278392736`
- **Project ArkID:** `https://arkid.researchark.eu/ARKP-0000000394321980`
- **Organization ArkID:** `https://arkid.researchark.eu/ARKO-0000000512938476`
- **Product ArkID:** `https://arkid.researchark.eu/ARKD-0000000667788990`

### **2. Entity Schemas**

### **3. How the 16-Digit Number is Generated**

The 16-digit number in ArkID is generated based on the **International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI)** guidelines. Here is how the generation process works:

1. **Unique Identifier Generation**: The 16-digit identifier is generated using a combination of:
   - **Sequential Numbers**: Ensures that each new ArkID is unique.
   - **Entity Metadata**: Attributes like entity creation date or type may be used as part of the generation to increase uniqueness.

2. **Checksum Calculation**: ISNI requires a checksum for validity.
   - The last digit of the 16-digit identifier is a **checksum** calculated using the previous digits to validate the identifier's integrity.
   - This checksum helps detect errors in data entry or transmission, offering an additional layer of verification.

3. **Global Uniqueness**: ISNI-compliance ensures that the ArkID remains unique across the globe, making it suitable for integration with other systems and platforms.

- Temporal.io workflows for complex approval processes

#### Relationship Management:
- Graph database extensions for tracking relationships between entities
- Temporal tracking of relationship start and end dates
- Role-based associations between entities

### **3. Verification for ArkID Creation**

Users must pass verification before being allowed to create ArkIDs for ideas, projects, organizations, or products. The verification process includes:

#### Verification Status Types:
- `Verified`: User has been approved to create ArkIDs for other entity types
- `Pending`: User has submitted verification request but approval is pending
- `Rejected`: User's verification request has been denied

#### Verification Process:
1. User submits verification request with supporting documentation
2. System administrators review the request
3. Status is updated to either "Verified" or "Rejected"
4. User is notified of the decision
5. Verified users can proceed with ArkID creation

#### Verification Requirements:
- Must have a complete user profile
- Must have valid institutional affiliation
- Must provide professional credentials
- Must agree to terms of use and data management policies

## **Public Resolving Service for ArkIDs**
