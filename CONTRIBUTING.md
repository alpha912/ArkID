# Contributing to ArkID

First off, thank you for considering contributing to ArkID! We appreciate your interest in helping build an open, sovereign identifier infrastructure for Europe's research and innovation ecosystem.

ArkID is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. Whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting a new feature, improving documentation, or writing code, your input is valuable.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it before contributing to ensure our community remains welcoming and respectful.

## How Can I Contribute?

ArkID is currently in the planning and early development phase (see the [Implementation Timeline in the README](README.md#implementation-timeline)). We are actively seeking funding and contributors to help realize the project's goals.

There are several ways you can contribute:

*   **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug in the code or documentation, please open an issue on our GitHub repository. Describe the bug clearly, including steps to reproduce it if possible.
*   **Suggesting Enhancements:** Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one? Open an issue to discuss it. We value community input on the project's direction.
*   **Improving Documentation:** Clear documentation is crucial. If you find areas that are unclear, incomplete, or incorrect, please submit a pull request with your improvements. This includes the main README, specifications in `/docs/specifications`, schemas in `/docs/schemas`, and other guides.
*   **Writing Code:** If you'd like to contribute code:
    1.  **Find an issue:** Look for open issues labeled `help wanted` or `good first issue`.
    2.  **Fork the repository:** Create your own copy of the ArkID repository.
    3.  **Create a branch:** Make your changes in a separate branch.
    4.  **Write code:** Ensure your code adheres to the project's standards and includes tests where appropriate.
    5.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Open a PR from your branch to the main ArkID repository. Clearly describe the changes you've made and link to the relevant issue.
